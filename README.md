This repository contains video demonstrations and model outputs from experiments where a mobile robot autonomously adapts its code using AI models to overcome unexpected obstacles during task execution.

### Video Demonstrations

1. **Scenario 1**

[![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/EWkyqFPNV08/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/EWkyqFPNV08)

- The robot follows its initial path until it encounters an obstacle. After a timeout period, it executes code generated by an AI model, allowing it to navigate around the obstacle and reach its goal.

2. **Scenarios 2 & 3**

- These videos apply the same AI-generated code to different obstacle placements. In both cases, the robot successfully avoids the obstacles and completes its task.

### Model Outputs

The repository includes inputs and outputs from the AI models used in the experiments. These documents show how the model reasoned about task failures and generated new code enabling the robot to adapt autonomously. A summary of the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is also provided.

- **Model Outputs**: The structured prompts and model-generated codes are located in the `/outputs` folder.

**Note:** One of the models demonstrated strong reasoning abilities but did not resolve the issue in a single attempt. In its trial, the robot turns upon detecting the obstacle but stops without reaching the goal.
