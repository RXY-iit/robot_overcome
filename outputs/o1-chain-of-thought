Thought for 11 seconds

Summary of CoT:

Analyzing the obstacle

OK, let me see. The robot starts moving towards its goal but stops due to an obstacle. After 20 seconds, it times out and reports its position, making me think about possible blocking issues or inefficiencies in the code.

Identifying the issue

I'm thinking through the original ROS node code and pinpointing why the robot missed its objective. This involves understanding the control laws in the follow_line function and proposing necessary code adjustments.

Identifying the issue

The robot detects an obstacle at 1.93m, halts, and times out after 20 seconds. The problem likely stems from a lack of obstacle avoidance in the code, as stopping immediately upon detection is insufficient.

Crafting code solutions

I’m creating fallback steps for the robot to bypass obstacles and reach the destination. This involves tweaking the ROS node code to integrate obstacle avoidance functionalities effectively.

Introducing obstacle avoidance

I'm thinking about coding the robot to navigate around obstacles using basic techniques like the "Bug Algorithm" or potential fields, ensuring smooth progress towards its goal.

Redirecting robotic action

I’m thinking through how to adjust the robot's response to obstacles. Instead of stopping, it should autonomously steer around them, ensuring a safe and direct path to its goal.
